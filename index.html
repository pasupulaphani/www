            <p>Hi, my name is Phaninder, but you can call me Phani. I've worked in various industries and technologies, and I take pleasure in solving problems. I believe a startup can happen anytime, whether it's fixing a daily problem or aiming for something as ambitious as going to Mars. I'm motivated to solve problems when I encounter them or to help anyone who is working on solutions.</p>
            <p>I'm a quick learner and eager to take on challenging tasks. I approach problems with sensible solutions and have a proven ability to form and motivate teams, leading to success in many hackathons.</p>
            <p>A random fact about me: I once said no to a promotion to work on an interesting project with uncertainty, demonstrating my passion for impactful work.</p>
            <p>I was an active participant in university event organizations, serving as a key member of the fundraising and marketing team for my university's cultural and technical fest in India. Our team of two successfully secured a gold sponsor.</p>
            <p>I've also won many national-level programming and technical contests in India.</p>
            <p>I travel frequently, often hitchhiking and couchsurfing, as I love meeting new people and experiencing different ways of life. I've worked for travel-based startups like Bubbloapp and avotravel.com, and in 2016, I worked for Pearlshare.com, building travel guides.</p>
